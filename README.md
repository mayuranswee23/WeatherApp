# WeatherApp

## In this project, we are tasked to use HTML, CSS and JS to create a Weather Application that will tell the current weather or a particular city as well as the 5 day forecast. The searches are also saved and can be selected upon later. Initially, the application looks blacnk when they log in.

When the user inputs a city, the current forecast, as well as the 5 day forecast will populate the page. The forecast includes the date, temperature, weather icon, wind speed, humidity and UV index. Also, the city name is saved in the search history if the user wants to view the wether for that particular city again.

When another city is inputted, the data will be replaced for weather at that particular city. The city will also be saved in the search results.

This application uses localStorage, loops, and if statements to create this project.
